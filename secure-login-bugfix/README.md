# 🧰 Secure Login Bug Fix – PHP & JavaScript

This project demonstrates a real-world bug fix for an insecure PHP login form using JavaScript validation and PHP session handling.

---

## 🔐 Problem

The original login form:
- Did not validate inputs with JavaScript
- Used plaintext credentials without session protection
- Was vulnerable to session hijacking and brute force attempts

---

## ✅ Solution

In the secure version:
- Added JS validation to block empty or invalid inputs
- Implemented PHP session management to track logins securely
- Used password hashing and proper redirect after login

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- PHP (Core, no framework)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- HTML/CSS
